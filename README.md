# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## NOTE
For Admin access to upload and delete files, make sure you use "?admin=true" after your URL i.e if it is "https://localhost:5173/?admin=true"

## ISSUES
I don't know if it's my browser but the difference between production and local development code is astonishing. There's a solution being worked on though
